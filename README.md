Cisco switch source code

I made this GIT to recall the things I need to when setting up a cisco switch
Use PUTTY and connect with console cable or via SSH at your Switch IP address: x.x.x.x

show running-config
show interfaces status
show interfaces vlan
show interfaces switchport
show vlan tag 1
show ip interface brief
show ip interface
show vlan brief

when setting vlan interface dont forget to call no shutdown to activate
set clock timezone utc 7
